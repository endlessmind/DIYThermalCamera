# DIYThermalCamera
 Fully working software to build a working thermal camera

## Status
Working:
- OV2640
- MLX90640
- Wifi
- Websocket
- Temperature color auto-rangeing in Android app
- MAX17043


Still todo:
- Render battery information on Android output
- Render temperature color map (I just skip this one, is it really needed?)
- Render current temperature range
- Maybe more settings like emissivity?
